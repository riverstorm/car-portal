# Car Portal

<b>This python script is used to generate a website which shows a variable amount of popular movies.</b>
<br>The amount of movies is set to 8 by default. 
<br><br>
Every movie is retrieved by using the themoviedb.org API and includes the title, story, poster image, 
a trailer url (youtube.com) and a link to buy or view the whole movie if available (amazon.com).

## An Udacity Project
The project is part of my Udacity course and uses some provided ressources.
<br><br>
<b>The requirements are exceeded by at least the following features or changes:</b>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Movies are retrieved by an API (themoviedb.org)</li>
  <li>Movies show an option to buy or view on demand (amazon.com)</li>
  <li>A new layout was created which is also fully responsive</li>
  <li>Bootstrap and jQuery are upgraded to the latest versions</li>
  <li>All external ressources are now served over HTTP<b>S</b></li>
</ul>

## Installation
### Requirements
<ul>
  <li>A Windows, Mac or Linux machine with Python 2 or higher</li>

### Instruction
<ol>
